# 🎯 GoPhish Phishing Simulation Project

## 📝 Overview

This project simulates a phishing attack using GoPhish to assess user awareness and response to social engineering threats. It was created as part of my cybersecurity studies at Polytechnic Mauritius.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate realistic phishing scenarios (Microsoft 365, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Track user interaction (opened, clicked, submitted, reported)
- Promote awareness and evaluate response behavior
- Learn practical skills in phishing simulation, email tracking, and secure testing

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) – to expose local server to the internet
- Google Forms – to simulate phishing reports
- Gmail – for receiving and sending emails
